# OK, that’s it for this lesson!
#
# ## Quick Review
#
# * We consumed some Kafka records that had been serialized with Avro and then
#   deserialized those records. Good stuff!
#
# ## Next Lesson
#
# Up next in lesson 3, coming soon: learn how to produce and consume
# Avro-encoded records with a Schema Registry.
#
# Since the next lesson’s not yet ready, we recommend you shut down the Kafka
# and ZooKeeper node that are running as Docker containers by running ./shutdown
