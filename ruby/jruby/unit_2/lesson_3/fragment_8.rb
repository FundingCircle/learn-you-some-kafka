# ## Quick Review
#
# * We serialized hashes using a local Avro schema that we registered with the
#   the schema registry and then produced them to a Kafka topic
# * We consumed those records from the topic and deserialized them by retrieving
#   the Avro schema on-the-fly from the schema registry
