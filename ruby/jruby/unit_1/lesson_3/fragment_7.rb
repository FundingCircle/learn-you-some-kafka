# ## Next Lesson
#
# Up next in lesson 4, coming soon: learn more about serialization and
# deserialization with Kafka so you can produce and consume complex (non-scalar)
# values.
#
#
# ## Cleanup
#
# We recommend you now shut down the Kafka broker and its
# supporting Zookeeper node in order to minimize load on
# your system by running ./shutdown
