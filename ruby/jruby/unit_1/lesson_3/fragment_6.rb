# ## Extra Credit
#
# Try running the lesson again. Observe what happens, and see if it lines up
# with what you expect. If not, you should be able to find an explanation in
# these docs on Consumer Groups:

#
#
# ## Links and Further Reading
#
# * An introduction to consumer groups:
#     https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#intro_consumers
#
# * For more on how to _think_ about Kafka — i.e. as a messaging system, storage
# system, data transport system, etc — and its data model, i.e. records vs
# messages, the introduction in the Kafka docs is excellent:
#     https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#introduction
#
#   The entire introduction is excellent; these specific parts are particularly
#   recommended:
#
#   * The introduction to the introduction
#   * Kafka as a Messaging System
#   * Kafka as a Storage System
#   * Kafka for Stream Processing
#   * Putting the Pieces Together
