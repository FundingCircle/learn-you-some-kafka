# And that’s it for this lesson!
#
#
# ## Quick Review
#
# * We’ve produced 3 records to Kafka, and confirmed that they actually made it
# * Each record has a nil key and a string value
# * Those string values are paragraphs of text without newlines
#
#
# ## Next Lesson
#
# Up next in lesson 2, coming soon: learn how to consume those records we just
# produced.
