# And that’s it for this lesson!
#
#
# ## Quick Review
#
# * We’ve produced 3 records to Kafka, and confirmed that they actually made it
# * Each record has a nil key and a string value
# * Those string values are paragraphs of text without newlines
#
#
# ## Next Lesson
#
# Up next in lesson 2: learn how to consume those records we just produced.
#
# To start the next lesson, run this in your shell:
#
# ./start lesson_2
#
# If you won’t be running the next lesson right now, we recommend you shut down
# the Kafka broker and ZooKeeper node that are running as Docker containers by
# running ./shutdown
#
# Note: If you do so, then when you do want to run the next lesson you’ll need
# to start the unit over from lesson 1, as each lesson depends on the records
# produced in the preceding lessons.
