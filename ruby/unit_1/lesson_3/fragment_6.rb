# OK, that’s it for this lesson!
#
#
# ## Quick Review
#
# * We’ve consumed 3 records from Kafka — the same 3 we
#   produced in lesson 1
# * Once we consume them, they’re (basically) just
#   key/value pairs — we can do whatever we want with them
#
#
# ## Extra Credit
#
# Try running the lesson again. Observe what happens, and
# see if it lines up with what you expect. If not, you
# should be able to find an explanation in these docs on
# Consumer Groups:
#   https://github.com/zendesk/ruby-kafka#consumer-groups

# ## Next Lesson
#
# Coming soon in lesson 4: learn how to use
# serialization and deserialization with Kafka so you can
# easily produce and consume complex values.
