# OK, that’s it for this lesson!
#
#
# ## Quick Review
#
# * We’ve consumed 3 records from Kafka — the same 3 we
#   produced in lesson 1
# * Once we consume them, they’re (basically) just
#   key/value pairs — we can do whatever we want with them
#

#
# ## Next Lesson
#
# Coming up next in lesson 3: learn how to use Consumer
# Groups to scale an appl across multiple machines and
# easily checkpoint progress so it can be resumed cleanly
# at any time.
#
# To start the next lesson, run this in your
# shell:
#
# cd ../lesson_3 && ./start.sh
