# That’s it for this lesson, and this unit!
#
#
# ## Quick Review
#
# * We’ve used both delivery_boy and ruby-kafka to produce
#   plain-text records to Kafka topics
# * We’ve used ruby-kafka’s “simple consumer” feature to
#   consume records
# * We’ve used ruby-kafka’s “consumer groups” feature to
#   consume records
# * We’ve produced records with serialized complex values
#   and then consumed and deserialized those records
#
#
# ## Cleanup
#
# We recommend you now shut down the Kafka broker and its
# supporting Zookeeper node in order to minimize load on
# your system by running ./shutdown
#
#
# ## Next Unit
#
# Unit 2 is on serializing and deserializing records with Avro.
#
# When you’re ready, you can start unit 2 by running:
#
# cd ../unit_2 && ./start
