# ## Next Lesson
#
# Up next in lesson 4: learn how to use serialization and deserialization with
# Kafka so you can easily produce and consume complex values.
#
# To start the next lesson, run this in your shell:
#
# ./start lesson_4
#
#
# ## Cleanup
#
# If you won’t be running the next lesson right now, we recommend you shut down
# the Kafka broker and ZooKeeper node that are running as Docker containers by
# running ./shutdown
#
# Note: If you do so, then when you do want to run the next lesson you’ll need
# to start the unit over from lesson 1, as each lesson depends on the records
# produced in the preceding lessons.
