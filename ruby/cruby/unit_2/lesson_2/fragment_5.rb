# ## Cleanup
#
# If you won’t be running the next lesson right now, we recommend you shut down
# the Kafka broker, ZooKeeper node, and Schema Registry that are running in the
# background as Docker containers by running ./shutdown
#
# Note: If you do so, then when you do want to run the next lesson you’ll need
# to start the unit over from lesson 1, as each lesson depends on the records
# produced in the preceding lessons.
