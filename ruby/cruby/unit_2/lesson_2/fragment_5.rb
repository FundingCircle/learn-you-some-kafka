# OK, that’s it for this lesson!
#
#
# ## Quick Review
#
# * We consumed some Kafka records that had been serialized with Avro and then
#   deserialized those records. Good stuff!
#
#
# ## Next Lesson
#
# Up next in lesson 3, coming soon: learn how to produce and consume
# Avro-encoded records with a Schema Registry.
#
# If you’d like to minimize load on your system, you can now shut down the Kafka
# broker and its supporting Zookeeper node like so:
#
# ./stop.sh
