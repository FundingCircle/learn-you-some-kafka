# OK, thatâ€™s it for this lesson!
#
#
# ## Quick Review
#
# * We consumed some Kafka records that had been serialized with Avro and then
#   deserialized those records. Good stuff!
#
#
# ## Next Lesson
#
# Up next in lesson 3, coming soon: learn how to produce and consume
# Avro-encoded records with a Schema Registry.
#
# We recommend you now shut down the Kafka broker and its
# supporting Zookeeper node in order to minimize load on
# your system by running ./shutdown.sh
