# OK, thatâ€™s it for this lesson!
#
# ## Quick Review
#
# * We consumed some Kafka records that had been serialized with Avro and then
#   deserialized those records. Good stuff!
#
# ## Next Lesson
#
# Up next in lesson 3: learn how to produce and consume
# Avro-encoded records with a Schema Registry.
#
# To start the next lesson, run this in your shell:
