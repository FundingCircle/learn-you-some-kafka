# OK, that’s it for this lesson!
#
#
# ## Quick Review
#
# * We parsed an Avro schema, prepped some hashes to be compatible with that
#   schema, serialized those hashes with that schema, and then produced those
#   serialized hashes to a Kafka topic. Pretty rad!
#
#
# ## Links and Further Reading
#
# * Avro:
#     http://avro.apache.org/
#
# * Avro docs:
#    http://avro.apache.org/docs/current/
#
# * Martin Kleppmann explains and compares how Avro, Protocol Buffers, and
#   Thrift approach schema evolution in “Schema evolution in Avro, Protocol
#   Buffers and Thrift”. Schema evolution is a fairly advanced topic, but
#   Kleppmann’s introduction is broadly helpful, so it’s recommended:
