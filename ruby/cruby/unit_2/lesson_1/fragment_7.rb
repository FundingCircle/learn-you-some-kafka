# OK, thatâ€™s it for this lesson!
#
#
# ## Quick Review
#
# * We parsed an Avro schema, prepped some hashes to be compatible with that
#   schema, serialized those hashes with that schema, and then produced those
#   serialized hashes to a Kafka topic. Pretty rad!
#
#
# ## Links and Further Reading

# ## Next Lesson
#
# Up next in lesson 2, coming soon: learn how to deserialize Avro data consumed
# from Kafka.
